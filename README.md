# CS:GO Autoexec Config

This repository contains my personal CS:GO autoexec config file. The autoexec file is a script that is automatically executed when launching Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) and can be used to customize various game settings and keybindings.

## Installation

To use this autoexec config, follow these steps:

1. Download the `autoexec.cfg` file from this repository.
2. Locate your CS:GO installation directory. By default, it is usually found at `Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive`.
3. Navigate to the `csgo\cfg` directory within the CS:GO installation directory.
4. Place the `autoexec.cfg` file in the `cfg` directory.

## Usage

The autoexec config provided in this repository includes various commands that customize CS:GO settings, such as network settings, main settings, ingame settings, crosshair configuration, field of view (FOV) settings, radar settings, HUD settings, sound settings, keybindings, and more.

To use the config, launch CS:GO, and the autoexec file will be automatically executed, applying the configured settings and keybindings.

Feel free to modify the autoexec.cfg file to suit your preferences by adding, removing, or adjusting the commands as needed.
